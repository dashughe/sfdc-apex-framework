# Trigger Settings

The trigger framework uses a custom setting called 'Trigger Settings' to provide configuration of each trigger handler. This custom setting provides a checkbox that allows a system admin to quickly disable a trigger from executing.

## Disable a trigger

1. Create a new Trigger Settings record with the name of your trigger handler (i.e. TasksDeleteMassMailerActivities)
2. Check the Disabled checkbox and save.
